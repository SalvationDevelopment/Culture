Trixie's ideas
==
Graphics:
--
I'm thinking that people who duel a lot should be able to unlock certain graphics on ygopro like having the deck shine/sparkle, have the field do some animations like have a character move, etc but nothing to hard.
Duels:
--
Have a ranking system where long-time duelists that used the program are sorted and put together in duels.
