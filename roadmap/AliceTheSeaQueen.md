What it is I aim to do, or get done, during my time as staff here:

Find every bug and discrepancy on the system I'm capable of finding, and get it fixed by any means.

Act as HR regards the community and attempt to move forward and moderate Salvation as a whole forward from a social standpoint.

Stop discrepancies between TCG and OCG rulings becoming an issue during duels, i.e. Auto chain order.

Assist the staff with rulings when/if a judge is needed. My strength isn't code, it's game mechanics, so I may as well play to that.

Work on Salvation staff's PR in general. A great strength of this sim is the staff and their reachable, friendly and active nature; it's important we make that much clear to the public.

Let's face it: I'll be learning at least some basic code whilst I'm here, so I may as well tack that on and all.

I don't personally believe that I'm capable of contributing anything but PR and forum moderation, but I'll do my best regardless. Hell, nobody loses anything if I'm wrong.

What I believe:

Everyone should at all times be TREATED equal, even if not everyone IS equal. Rank should only be pulled when an action is absolutely necessary.

Staff don't have to like one another, but they have to be willing to tolerate and work alongside one another.

Manual's more fun than automated, but that requires the manual sim to be properly maintained and run, which DN fails to provide.

Those in higher power should always be willing to listen.

Those lower down should never fear backlash for stating their opinion, no matter how controversial.

If a user has a problem with another user, staff, owner or regular user, this should always be resolved by addressing said problem directly to said person.

You don't post bait to see who doesn't like you, then exile them.
