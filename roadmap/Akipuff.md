I think having a profile would be nice. Like on DN, we could have a picture (Uploadable though, it'd be sad to have to be forced to choose 1 from specific ones.) and status messages. And like on DevPro, we could see detailed statistic. How many of what kind of duels were won, lost, and things like that.
 
Having a team like on Dev would also be nice. But it should have an image and stuff too, like how all team have a flag/symbol! :3
 
Being able to see main and private chats in duels would be a good feature, too. Like, make 2 buttons, one for private and one for main (Like on DN) and open a tab that has chat, and you can also minimize it.
 
Add longer times to the timer, or remove it. I had duels I lost only because of timer. And I think adding the feautre I mentioned previously would require longer or no timer.
 
Also we should TOTALLY be able to cancel special summoning and activation of other cards. I see people complaining about it.
 
Having Puzzle and AI modes would be nice too. (Do we have them? I didn't check yet.) And we could make our own puzzles to add to them too.
 
And adding something like a tutorial on how to duel on the FAQ tab, I see many people in chat asking how to duel. (Seriously...)

Will add more as I get more ideas.
