Zetsuei's Method of Upgrades!:
==
*More Anime Cards and Anime Banlist and method of dueling with said anime cards in proper duels.

*Bots to duel against perhaps using the percy bot so you can duel against any deck you desire but program it to be more skilled maybe add a range of different skill settings.

*Maintain a growing community and staff that will be productive without being corrupt and maintaining a proper conduct and lead by example.

*Add easier customization options for the launcher so people can upload their own images, card skins, and even sound files and music.

*A Puzzle editor mode would be pretty cool, where you could make your own puzzles.

*A donation feature for more money to be obtained and allow people to support the game and the servers.

*Keep up to date and maintain a steady stream of growth for the game and launcher as well as our staff, More updates to come in the future as I think of them.
