Please note that my ideals are more subject to change than Necrovalley's errata.

The following also assumes that most, if not all, features of DevPro are used.

High priority (For YGODS[working title])

- Comprehensive Ranking System
 * Matchup Finder (details to be explained)
 * Harsher punishments for boosting
- Faster Debugging Process
- Regular Tournaments/Return of the WCS (can be delayed until playerbase reaches high enough capacity
- "File Bug Report" option in interface (Possible this is already being integrated into the comprehensive Gui)
- Browser interface available (I am NOT going to hear "it's a virus/I use a Mac" as an excuse to not use a Pro anymore)
- Artifical Intelligence Option
 * Online and Offline
 * Multiple levels of difficulty
 * Fully customizable
 * Highest level of difficulty on par with...well me.
 * Make Replays Better
 * Roll back updates when viewing old replays(?)
 * Automatically drop them into your directory
- Add "Directory"/"Database" button in the gui (More dumbing down of the components needed to run the software)
- More comprehensive deck editor
 * For gods sakes GET PERCY'S SEARCH ENGINE BACK ITS WAY BETTER
 * Separate "Normal/Effect/Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Pendulum" from "Toon/Gemini/Spirit/Tuner"
 * Add "last edited" date for decklists
 * Sorter for Format Deck is meant for
- Manual for various things
 * What is Checkmate
 * How to connect via Hamachi
 * How to build a deck/host a game/friend and/or ignore people/run the interface
- Gameplay fixes
 * Take back tributes, extra deck summon choices, etc
