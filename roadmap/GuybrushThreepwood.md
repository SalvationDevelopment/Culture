###Deck Constructor
- Ease of use: right click to add/remove from deck
- Comprehensive search: i.e. allow searching for name and description separately IMO
- Not case sensitive (some of those searches are and it's more annoying than useful)
- Gather Types/Attributes/Subtypes/Icons from the card database rather than having a static list
- Prompts before saving over or clearing deck
- Track how many of each card type (Monster/Spell/Trap/Xyz/Synchro, possibly monster types like Ritual/Pendulum/Effect/Normal too)


###Rated
- Similar to DNï¿½' rating system might be fine, which is ELO-based. Open to better suggestions.
- Categories: Single/Matches, not sure if should be split TCG/OCG or not.
- A separate traditional rated might be fun.
- Manual duel selection MIGHT be fine, but perhaps limit the number of times per day people can play each other in rated.
- A pool similar to DN might not be a bad idea.


###Unrated
- Duel notes should be allowed here (not sure if PRO allows them or not)
- Categories: TCG, OCG, TCG+OCG, TCG Traditional, Unlimited, Past lists, etc.
In-Duel
- ALL CARDS SUPPORTED (This means even face-up in deck, view top of opponent's deck, re-order opponent's deck, and everything else not currently supported by DN). This includes manual.
- Chat log
- Watchers and watchers chat
- REAL TAG DUELING with 4 zones and correct rulings would be a big plus and something the others don't have.
- Admins should be able to enter games and be able to pause timers/fix game states/give game losses/etc if called on. Even in automatic. Since rulings should be kept up to date there shouldn't be a huge need for this but having an admin or mod or whatever the position may be, able to fix stuff would be a huge things against people who really dislike bad rulings. Since bad rulings are inevitable.

###Manual vs Automatic
- Players should be given the choice for manual vs. automatic
- Rulings should be handled via a separate rulings channel and not calling a judge
- Judges could still be there in cases where players refuse to comply, stall, or harass.
- If we don't have enough staff, possible that manual is for unrated duels only. There should still be a rulings channel, but staff intervention would be reduced.
- For automatic, we would need staff who know about OCG rulings that can interpret things for us. Similar to what Pharaoh Atem does for DN.

###Tournaments
- Tournaments should be integrated into the client
- There should be a spot on the screen for Tournament starting now with listed rules such as format (Single-elim, TCG/OCG, etc) and a button people can click to join
- Having this is where DN/Pros are lacking because tournaments are organized outside of the client and therefore tournament turnout is smaller.
Would be nice (but not essential)
- CCG Support, possibly through a downloadable client instead of browser-based
- Separate card collection format, earning packs instead of having all available immediately

###Donations
- Could be there to help support server costs.
- Donation benefits could include custom sleeves/avatars like DN possible.
- Perhaps letting people donate to host their own custom card pool on the server itself.
