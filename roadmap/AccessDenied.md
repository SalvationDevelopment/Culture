Get the fucker running:
--
> Right now the system doesnt even work, it doesnt play a game of Yu-Gi-Oh, it needs to be able to do that.
* A proper marketable name
* Landing site featuring the system name as its domain name
* Potential to handle 10,000 user connections at any given time
* WordPress for site management
* A Logical and high usiablity forum

Fix the staff:
--
> Current staff is passinate yet frozen in fear or lack of self worth with in the group. Also there are other issues.
* Each member is to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Networking Basics
* Each member will learn to create a development area and deploy a copy of the system 
* Dont hire anyone that cant install WAMP or write an MD file on Github.
* Dont hire anyone that wont engage me in proper conversation on introduction or respond within 48hrs of being addressed
* Dont hire anyone in the YGOrg or from DN unless someone is gonna spend 3 weeks beating the stupid out of them then teach them social basics.
* Get the staff to feel that they are peers and can trust each other on a personal level.
* I need to stop doing all the work
* Teach how critical the stuff I can not do and ask them to do is (better)


Dont make the mistakes of DuelingNetwork:
--
> DN has done many things correctly but it has done many things wrong that have hurt the community. 
* Nginx, Nodejs, Apache with Fast-CGI PHP, Mercury, MariaDB, MongoDB(?) working as the HTTP and Application Servers.
* The administration of the system should not be a social class derived from the userbase and then given absolute power over them. This causes nothing but corruption. Manul gameplay mode should be as _Xerocreative_ had it an pool of people in a single place to defer to. The sim should not cause social problems
* Development and should be user driven and truthful about what the system can and can not do and why.
* Dont let competitive players run everything they drain the fun out of everything and run a much unchecked. Intellegent and hardworking yet unimagitive folk.
* Dont let people do what computers should be doing and computers what people should be doing.

Dont make the mistakes of Xerocreative:
--
> Xerocreative created a very lively and dynamic community, it was fluid and issues in it where allowed to fade not fester.
* Monitor the emotional health of the staff
* Be open source.
* Own your faults and fix them.
* Stay upto date.
* Keep Developing and dont punish others for developing.

Dont make the mistakes of FH-China, TDOANE, DevPro or Percy.
--
> DevPro came to be for a few reasons It addressed many conserns in the first few systems at the time of launch
* Support all Languages
* Do not ignore your userbase
* The user Expierence comes first.
* Dont make the user download anything, people are fucking idiots
* Figure out your funding first!!!
* Bug test
* You cant gun alone, you need trust

Do what DuelingNetwork did right!
--
> DuelingNetwork is a complex and wonderful system aspects of it need to live on into the next generations if it does not evolve.
* Live in the browser, and on the server.
* Ranking is important, and should have a prominace (but not to much!)

Do what Xerocreative did right!
--
> Xerocreative was the first hugely successful free sim, it did alot right especially socially.
* IRC allows adhoc systems, this is good keeps multiple abusive and hackable communities from croping up and producing outcasted scum that hack sims due to internal personal issues. It allows them to calm down emotionally and solve problems for themselves.
* Do not compete with everyone, friends are good
* Hack your own shit!
* Intergration is good
* Manual game play is good

Do what YGOPro did right!
--
> YGOPro is an amazing system and I consider this sim to be a variant so its going to do everything that system did and more!
* Automation is KEY!
* Customization is important
* Replays are amazing.
* Stay open, stay honest, stay friendly.
