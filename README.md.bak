Actual Rules
============

The following are the only core rules and policies, in no particular order.

- Jamezs "AccessDenied" Gladney is singularly incharge. Everyone else is an equal under him.
    - Violation of this or direct insubortnation will result in being asked and/or potentially strong armed, into leaving the project.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - Pay attention for, **"... thats an order."** It significes invoking this clause.
    - Any development and/or production servers must be owned/rented/leased/procurred by AccessDenied.
- If there is a problem with the software file a bug.
- If there is a problem between you and another staff member resolve it quickly and apologize sincerly and mutually.

- If there is a problem with the software, file a bug.
>>>>>>> origin/master
- Do not take work you can not complete in a timely manner, or show progress of completing.
- We are making software for users, not developers. Don't make things that are locked to one operating system, lack UI, require many dependencies or require crafted non-default configuration.
    - Setup should be as few steps as possible.
- Do not leave the development room in an argumentative state, this signifies the same as abandoning your post. You forfeit administrative privileges and staff status by doing this.
- Use version control, this is not negotiable.

Logic for Rules
===============
If something is a rule it means there is a breakdown of communication, function, or ideology between two or more people chronically in a situation. A rule is an artifical solution for lack of principle.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- The person experiencing an annoyance likely to inappropriately prioritize it and miscommunicate it via the lens of annoyance, and the person being notified will natually forget or may not be the appropriate person to solve the problem. People should not be punished for doing things that are natural. So the person that has the ablity to resolve the issue needs a way to become familiar with the issue at a later time, even possibly fail to solve it on the first try and have a mechanism to review it yet again. Bug reports and issue tracking provide a medium for both the staff and the users to equally experience an issue.
- Communication is the basis of the human condition realizing an idea that effects social change. Harming this is an attack on the group. This behavior will not be supported. Keeping secrets from the group about the group is harming the group. For this reason we try to keep everyone in the main staff room so they can effectively communicate and learn at minimum by osmosis. Conflicts are natural and must be sorted. After resolution both parties are required to apologize to each other sincerly so the group can resume normal working conditions. Arguments effect the whole group not just those involved.
- You will make mistakes, except that. You will forget things, except that, you will need to communicate, except that, you will need to communicate with people and computers, accept that. Accept version control.

Culture
=======

A collection of the top to middle socially adjusted, mildly depressed YGO players world wide. They are dicks, perverted, spastic, nerdy, anxious, awkward, patient, helpful, innovative, and concerned with the mental well-being and happiness of those around them. They possess great problem solving and communication skills. They are passionate about Yu-Gi-Oh! and connecting with others.

- People are the most important asset.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Take care of your non-Salvation related life responsiblities before taking care of Salvation related things.
- Be honest, with your coworkers and self.
=======
- Be honest, with your co-workers and self.
>>>>>>> origin/master
- For the user experience, make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.
- **Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.**
- It doesn't matter when or how much you work, only that your peers trust you and feel like you are contributing. Minimum work load is simply doing as asked in a prompt manner.
- Document everything.
- Don't hire people, people will hire themselves.
- If you work in the dark and by yourself, you are working for nothing.
- Unicorns, unicorns everywhere.
- Write goals down publically.
- Orginization and structure is temporary. There will be people that have deeper understandings of how certain systems work you will need to get feedback and leadership from other than AccessDenied. This is at will and ad hoc of the one acting in the submissive role.
- Mistakes dont hurt people, malicious intent hurts people.
- Salvation is software development centric, it helps if you start learning the basics of the languages or atleast help in the documentation of our products. We provide education tailored to you as you request them. At minimum dabble in trying to read the code base most closely tied to your job function.
- Problematic arguments are only caused by injuries of self-esteem. *You are responsible for the self-esteem of others.*
- Salvation Development and our products are privately funded by the staff solely, we do not take donations.

**Development Practices**
- Use Github, and commit often.
- Work off a branch, except during core development.
- File bug reports/issues, and set up a task list for what you are doing.
- Dont break `master`.
- **Code in `JavaScript` or `Go`.** C# and C++ exist in our codebase and we are trying to get away from those!
- No `Ruby`, `Java`, `Python`, `C`, no whatever other language you are thinking of!
- No `CoffeeScript`, `TypeScript`, or `Dart`!
- Quality is free for those that pay for it. Take the time to fix something, there are no deadlines here. Keep your estimates to yourself and get it done.
- Before taking on a large task, get rest. Program somewhere peaceful and in comfort.

**Things we suck at**
- Not killing each other when AccessDenied is sleep.

> "Do not run, do not back down, face every issue and do not rest till you work it out with the people here."
> "Anarchy works wonderfully in a small group of individuals with a high level of trust, the YGO community is not such a group of people."

-Access


> "No one here is worthless and we are going to prove that!"

-Trixie


> "...You have a decision to make. 1. Let it go, move on, join the chat and live it up. 2. Confront the people and come to a positive resolution or 3. Simply don't come here. All 3 of those choices are yours. Coming here and being an asshole just because you can and you're still mad about what happened isn't one of them."

-Ryder
