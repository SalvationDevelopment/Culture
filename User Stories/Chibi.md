Mew's list of desired features!:
--

* Anime/CCG support from server, including replays.

* Allow a sealed format (Currently BP02). Possibly with a feature to draft the decks.

* Add Boss Duel functionality.

* Anime format with it's own banlist. Only a specific selection of cards, ran by us/community.

* Return of "Copy Deck List" from the Deck Builder.

* Filter for cards that are not yet released (Only spoiled). They shouldnt be TCG nor OCG nor Anime.

* Feature to share Deck/replays from the chat interface within the program.

* Change the SHUFFLE HAND THING to some button elsewhere, NOT in every card.

* Add the handicap duel option that the Checkmate server has. 2v1 and maaaaaybe 3v1.

* Being able to check the graveyard when a card like Pot of Duality or Dark World Dealings is resolving.

* Being able to use Battle Phase quick effects like ignitions (next to attack and stuff)

* Being able to watch replays with player hands hidden or revealed, with a button or checkbox. For spectating.

* Deck builder screen showing more cards in the result screen at the same time, perhaps 2 columns. More clearly defined "Effect" text search.
*
* More options to prevent misclicks, such as being able to cancel out when the simulator is asking what monsters would you like to use for a Tribute Summon, Synchro Summon, Xyz Summon, etc
