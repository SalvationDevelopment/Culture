I blame the time for my current lack of imagination:

*CCG Support

*Filter cards by their description as well as their names.

*Cancel a Xyz/Pendulum/Synchro Summon before selecting the Materials (For misclicks, maybe?)

*Goyo Emperor has "Raidraptor - Wild Vulture"s Thumbnails and needs to have the Miracle Synchro Fusion Setcode (257)

*An AI to which Test Decks/New Cards against, I find it both easiest and fastest. 

*Can it be made impossible to overwrite a Deck with cards on it with one that's completely empty in the Editor? I've lost entire decklists by hitting save just because of instict.

*Custom (And Reasonable) Banlist made by Polls/Voting from members?

*A "Rulings" Tab in the Server, although that may take a lot of work for all cards, it can be done for new ones, so others can reference the Do's and Don'ts of certain cards.
