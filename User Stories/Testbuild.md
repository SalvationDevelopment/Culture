* Improve speed and user-experience of the game.

  Right now, I ***hate*** playing the game. It is really slow feels like a chore getting things to work. Dueling Nexus' is fun; Salvation is fustrating. Although I am not sure if it is the servers or the programs, but speed needs to be dramatically improved, everywhere! 

* Start a rock-paper-scissors game to decide who goes first.
* Real-time searching engine instead of game hosting.
* Some music during the game would be nice.
