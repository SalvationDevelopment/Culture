* Improve speed and user-experience of the game.

  Right now, I ***hate*** playing the game. It feels like a chore getting things to work. Dueling Nexus' is fun; Salvation is fustrating. Although I am not sure if it is the servers or the programs, but speed needs to be dramatically improved, everywhere! 


* Remove artwork alterations (hard to take the game seriously and I cannot recognize certain cards).
* Automate drawing of cards, it is annoying to have to manually draw your initial hand. 
* Start a rock-paper-scissors start up.
* Real-time searching engine instead of game hosting.
* Some music during the game would be nice.
* This game needs much, much better marketing. I never heard of Salvation, and there are very few people playing.
