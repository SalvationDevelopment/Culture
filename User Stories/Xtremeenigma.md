Functions of admin and mod personelle...
=========
Well admins right away is Access, he'll hire, fire, promote, demote and give instructions to everyone. The difference is Access will actually lead us and help us instead of bark orders and sit back. Mods are made by access and they are there to keep order, As for how i fit into it, thats up to Access to decide. 


There should be at least 3 levels. Admin being the highest, high mod- they can ban, kick, perma ban, mute etc and low mod- this will be for starter mods or staff who are mainly focused on coding and the workings of the game. they will have limited powers like kick, mute, ban. if i am not mistaken we are going to use IRC, so admin would have ~, other staff will have & and new hires will have a @ or % depending on how good they are.


I do wish there was some way in the coding we could put for mods to interfere in matches if there are complaints, that way the mods can act quickly and without much commotion.


I want there to be a way in the chat we can open up a new room for games like trivia, uno etc
when it comes to the point of us needing to hire more mods they will go through a simple test and will be talked about through all of the staff. If they pass the test but fail to get along with staff then they will not be hired.

side games...
=========
I just thought of the idea with Trixies card effects idea as well as the RPG idea that we make a side game where we start with a structure deck of our choosing, and we go through the game, each duel we win we get a booster and some game cash. each booster has a chance to get a rare, super rare, ultra, ghost etc. this game will have trades and a shop to buy/sell cards. we can make our own decks off that, just a fun thing to try out and it gets rid of the net decks and makes people think about what they can build with random cards
AGAIN THIS IS NOT A PRIORITY THING
