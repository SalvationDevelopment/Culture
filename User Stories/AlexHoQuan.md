Alex Ho Quan (Tsundere)
This will be my plan to develop this game community further as well as contributing to the game.I have quite a lot of ideas at the moment but this will be my resume of the totality of the assets that should be implemented.

####Management

- To be able to work in multi-disciplinary teams

- Have each partition to do seperate jobs and give their own contribution for each individual task

- Have imagination and creativy

- Management of the Banlisted users of the database

- Enforce the commitment to players to agree the user terms.

- Make sure any image/files diffused on the chat are appropriate and respects the agreement.
- The ability to end a game remotely due to misconduct

####Improvements on the software and design

- Build up an In-Dept Tutorial for yugioh beginners and people who have artistic desire.

- An In-Dept tutorial for people who want to script cards and have their own database of cards.

- Allowance of customizable custom cards on the server as well as addition of the Anime based cards from Ygopro Percy.

- Adding Customizable Music to the software and let people choose their own song and music

- Seperating the Meta from the non-competitive players and have an ELO based system similar to Checkmate server. (OCG/TCG)

-  Availability of disabling the Stats shown in the game and or in unranked duels 

- Have an alternative dueling mode such as (FFA) with unlimited ammount of players but with a pre-defined limitation or example 1v2 ,4v4, 5v5, 6v6)

-  Availability to have a our own channel room or social tab where people can communicate with each other on a microphone/webcam that can toggled on and off during game or in settings so people can talk instead of typing. Features could include microphone, avatars, and webcam integration.

- Addition of a Black list system where people can block people from joining their games.

- Ability to revert back plays due to people misclicking

- Have a system where people can reconnect to their game state like in League of Legends due to people disconnecting from games 
and getting a loss which basically means they lost ELO.
(Useful in rated duels or tournament events) (Example of concept). After a short period of time (1 to 5min) a message will display "Your opponent has disconnected, do you wish to wait?"
and upon that player reopening the client, they are automatically connected to the game, otherwise it will replay that you win and end the game.

######Aesthestic changes

- A Personalizer for in-game elements such as background,music,sounds,sleeves, and textures as well as having a File transfer client(Dropbox) so people can share their files
(Decks,Artwork,Sleeves,Texture packs,Replays)

- An very advanced replay manager with aesthetic changes where people can see opponent's sleeves and manage to copy decks or sleeves in specific folder.

- Customization Preferences for your opponent as well, such as sounds, covers, and textures.

####Marketing

- Advertise your game and make a Youtube channel officialy dedicated to tournament games and events.

- Able to stream your tournaments live on Twitch

- Produce Shirt designs with the salvation logo and build a site where can people buy it.
