#### Suggestions/Ideas/whatever the hell you wanna call em

- Highly adaptive but with the best defaults possible
  - Power users should be able to change options of their duels, deck edits, etc as they see fit, but default options should match those most used by the community
  - Somehwat lower-level parts of the system should be available to users. For example, one should be able to write deck files manually in a human-readable format and import them- not something most users will want to do, but those who do should have that freedom- don't trap the user in your code's box
- Clean, easy to use UI
- Easily customizable/themable UI
- completely web-based client
  - Integrative web features such as notifications
- Manual and automatic modes
- Every action should be cancelable in auto mode before it is committed. misclicks, accidents, and stupid mistakes happen
- On the other hand, this option can be disabled, just like in a real duel you might hold a player to his choice and not allow "takebacks"
- More social features- chat, forums, friends, sharing decks, replays, etc.
- User-setup tournaments
- User-designed cards, duel rules, banlists (opt-in only)
- more generalized AI- one that "knows" the game instead of an AI deck- such that you could give the AI a deck and it will find a good strategy in it
- Ranked, unranked modes
- User-submitted puzzles
